# `CODSOFT Data Science Internship`

Welcome to the CODSOFT Data Science Internship repository! Here, you will find my contributions to the internship tasks, showcasing my skills and dedication to the field of data science.

## `Tasks Completed`

### `Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction`
In this classic beginner project, I utilized the Titanic dataset to build a predictive model determining whether a passenger survived or not. The model incorporates key features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin information. Check out the Jupyter Notebook in the [Task 1 folder](./Task_1_Titanic_Survival_Prediction) for a detailed walkthrough.

### `Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection`
Developing a robust machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions was the focus of this task. I addressed challenges such as data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, and employing classification algorithms. Dive into the details in the [Task 2 folder](./Task_2_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection).

### `Task 3: Sales Prediction Using Python`
Predicting future sales is crucial for businesses, and I delved into this realm by forecasting product purchases. Leveraging machine learning techniques in Python, I analyzed factors like advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. Explore the implementation in the [Task 3 folder](./Task_3_Sales_Prediction) for insights.
